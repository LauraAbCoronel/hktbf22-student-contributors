### Hacktoberfest 2022 for Treehouse TechDegree Students
# Project 1 - TechDegree Student Contributors

Welcome to Hacktoberfest learners! This is one of the projects that we have created for you so you can experience Hacktoberfest in a safe and encouraging environment.

In this first project, you are encouraged to tackle 2 issues:
1. Issue #1 for everyone: add yourself to the list of contributors. This is a great way to practice your first Pull Request.
2. Pick a 2nd issue that you would like to work on! Make sure you comment on the issue or ping me (Rachel) on Slack to claim the issue and so I can assign you to it.



## New to Pull Requests?
Not to worry, we were all there once! Here are a few resources to help you along the way

And as always, feel free to reach out in Slack if you have any questions!
