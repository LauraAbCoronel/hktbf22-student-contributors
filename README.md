### Hacktoberfest 2022 for Treehouse TechDegree Students
# Project 1 - TechDegree Student Contributors

Welcome to Hacktoberfest learners! This is one of the projects that we have created for you so you can experience Hacktoberfest in a safe and encouraging environment.

This project is a simple one! We want to pull together a nice one-page website that showcases all the TechDegree students who are contributing to Open Source projects for Hacktoberfest this year!


## Contributing (Please read!)

This project was created for Treehouse TechDegree students to be able to try their hand at Pull Requests and to work on an open source project together.

Please refer to [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions and rules to contribute to this project. You can also reach out in your TechDegree Slack's #hacktoberfest2022 channel!
