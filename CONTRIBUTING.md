### Hacktoberfest 2022 for Treehouse TechDegree Students
# Project 1 - TechDegree Student Contributors

Welcome to Hacktoberfest learners! This is one of the projects that we have created for you so you can experience Hacktoberfest in a safe and encouraging environment.

In this first project, you are encouraged to tackle 2 issues:
1. Issue #1 for everyone: add yourself to the list of contributors. This is a great way to practice your first Pull Request.
2. Pick a 2nd issue that you would like to work on! Make sure you comment on the issue or ping me (Rachel) on Slack to claim the issue and so I can assign you to it.


## How to claim an Issue
1. Comment on the Issue with your TechDegree and Slack name: `I would like to be assigned this Issue. My Slack handle is Rachel Johnson and I'm in the Python TechDegree. Thank you!`
2. Pop a message in your TechDegree's #hacktoberfest2022 channel. The message must include the Hacktoberfest project number and the issue number: `Please can I be assigned Issue #4 of Project 1? My Github username is rachelktyjohnson. Thank you!`
3. A repo maintainer will respond to you ASAP to make sure that you've commented on the Issue on Github. If all is well, you will be assigned the Issue.
4. Start working away on it!

**NOTE: Any comments that do not follow these instructions will be ignored**
